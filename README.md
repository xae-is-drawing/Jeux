Just a French student who sometimes uses free time to code games for fun.

> Games you can play

— Hangman in Python (please, note that you will have to install the `wonderwords` package. (Learn more about this package [here](https://github.com/mrmaxguns/wonderwordsmodule).)
— 2048 in Python

> Why do I code this?

I don't know honestly. I'm just a fan of the 2048 game, and tried to code it for fun. (On my phone, because why not. And on the Notes App, because why not².) That's how it started.
And now? I'm willing to code more games, in differents programming languages to train myself and see the differences between them.
